-----------------What is Relative Humidity?------------------

The DHT11 measures relative humidity. Relative humidity is the amount of water vapor in air vs. 
the saturation point of water vapor in air. 
At the saturation point, water vapor starts to condense and accumulate on surfaces forming dew.

The saturation point changes with air temperature. 
Cold air can hold less water vapor before it becomes saturated, 
and hot air can hold more water vapor before it becomes saturated.

The formula to calculate relative humidity is:

RH = (pw/ps)*100%

RH: Relative Humidity
pw: Density of water vapor
ps: Density of water vapor at saturation

Relative humidity is expressed as a percentage. At 100% RH, condensation occurs, 
and at 0% RH, the air is completely dry.

--------------How the DHT11 Measures Humidity and Temperature------------------------

The DHT11 detects water vapor by measuring the electrical resistance between two electrodes. 

The humidity sensing component is a moisture holding substrate with electrodes applied to the surface.
When water vapor is absorbed by the substrate, ions are released by the substrate which increases the conductivity between the electrodes. 
The change in resistance between the two electrodes is proportional to the relative humidity.
Higher relative humidity decreases the resistance between the electrodes, while lower relative humidity increases the resistance between the electrodes.

The DHT11 measures temperature with a surface mounted NTC temperature sensor (thermistor) built into the unit.

----------------------Setup-------------------------------

The DHT11 uses just one signal wire to transmit data to the Arduino. Power comes from separate 5V and ground wires. 
A 10K Ohm pull-up resistor is needed between the signal line and 5V line to make sure the signal level stays high by default (see the datasheet for more info).
